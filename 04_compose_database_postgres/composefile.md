Sure! Let's go through the `docker-compose.yml` file line by line to understand each part:

```yaml
version: "3.9"
```
- **version: "3.9"**: This specifies the version of the Docker Compose file format. Version 3.9 is compatible with Docker Engine version 19.03.0 and above. It defines the syntax and features available in the compose file.

```yaml
name: myapi
```
- **name: myapi**: This is an optional project name. It can be used to group multiple services under a single project name. If not specified, Docker Compose will use the directory name as the project name.

```yaml
services:
```
- **services**: This section defines the services that make up your application. Each service is like a container instance.

```yaml
  api:
```
- **api**: This is the name of the first service. You can name it anything, but typically it's named after the role it performs.

```yaml
    build:
      context: ./todo
      dockerfile: Dockerfile.dev
```
- **build**: This section is used to build the Docker image for the `api` service.
  - **context: ./todo**: The build context is set to the `./todo` directory. This means Docker will look for the Dockerfile and other files needed for the build in this directory.
  - **dockerfile: Dockerfile.dev**: Specifies the Dockerfile to use for building the image. In this case, it's `Dockerfile.dev` located in the context directory.

```yaml
    depends_on:
      - postgres_db
```
- **depends_on**: This defines dependencies between services. It ensures that the `postgres_db` service is started before the `api` service. Note that it does not wait for `postgres_db` to be "ready," just for it to be started.

```yaml
    ports:
      - "8000:8000"
```
- **ports**: This maps ports between the host and the container.
  - **"8000:8000"**: Maps port 8000 on the host to port 8000 on the container, making the `api` service accessible at `http://localhost:8000`.

```yaml
    networks:
      - my-api-net
```
- **networks**: Specifies the networks to which the service should be connected.
  - **my-api-net**: Connects the `api` service to the `my-api-net` network, which is defined later in the file.

```yaml
    environment:
      - DATABASE_HOST=postgres_db
      - DATABASE_PORT=5432
      - POSTGRES_USER=abdulqadir
      - POSTGRES_PASSWORD=my_password
      - POSTGRES_DB=mydatabase
```
- **environment**: This sets environment variables for the service.
  - **DATABASE_HOST=postgres_db**: Sets the database host to the service name `postgres_db`.
  - **DATABASE_PORT=5432**: Sets the database port to 5432.
  - **POSTGRES_USER=abdulqadir**: Sets the PostgreSQL username to `abdulqadir`.
  - **POSTGRES_PASSWORD=my_password**: Sets the PostgreSQL password to `my_password`.
  - **POSTGRES_DB=mydatabase**: Sets the PostgreSQL database name to `mydatabase`.

```yaml
  postgres_db:
```
- **postgres_db**: This is the name of the second service, which will run a PostgreSQL database.

```yaml
    image: postgres:latest
```
- **image**: Specifies the Docker image to use for the service.
  - **postgres:latest**: Uses the latest version of the official PostgreSQL image.

```yaml
    restart: always
```
- **restart: always**: Ensures that the container is always restarted if it stops. This can be useful for ensuring high availability.

```yaml
    container_name: PostgresCont
```
- **container_name**: Sets a custom name for the container. In this case, it's named `PostgresCont`.

```yaml
    environment:
      - POSTGRES_USER=abdulqadir
      - POSTGRES_PASSWORD=my_password
      - POSTGRES_DB=mydatabase
```
- **environment**: Sets environment variables for the `postgres_db` service.
  - **POSTGRES_USER=abdulqadir**: Sets the PostgreSQL username to `abdulqadir`.
  - **POSTGRES_PASSWORD=my_password**: Sets the PostgreSQL password to `my_password`.
  - **POSTGRES_DB=mydatabase**: Sets the PostgreSQL database name to `mydatabase`.

```yaml
    ports:
      - '5433:5432'
```
- **ports**: Maps ports between the host and the container.
  - **'5433:5432'**: Maps port 5433 on the host to port 5432 on the container. This allows accessing the PostgreSQL service at `localhost:5433`.

```yaml
    volumes:
      - my_postgres_db:/var/lib/postgresql/data
```
- **volumes**: Mounts a volume to persist data.
  - **my_postgres_db:/var/lib/postgresql/data**: Maps the `my_postgres_db` volume to the container's PostgreSQL data directory, ensuring that data persists even if the container is restarted.

```yaml
    networks:
      - my-api-net
```
- **networks**: Connects the `postgres_db` service to the `my-api-net` network.

```yaml
volumes:
  my_postgres_db:
    driver: local
```
- **volumes**: Defines named volumes to persist data.
  - **my_postgres_db**: Defines the volume named `my_postgres_db`.
    - **driver: local**: Specifies the use of the local volume driver to persist data on the host.

```yaml
networks:
  my-api-net:
```
- **networks**: Defines custom networks.
  - **my-api-net**: Defines a custom network named `my-api-net`, which is used to connect the `api` and `postgres_db` services.
